# Design Rendering — finishing the concept designs (issue #63)

**Status:** Phase 1 implemented — registry + the five #63 call-outs, verified in
Chromium across all three styles (country pages, world map, leaderboard,
sign-in). The ⬜ items in the tables below are the remaining systematic worklist.
**Branch:** `claude/design-rendering-iwmzwx`
**Design sources:** [`docs/designs/`](../designs/README.md) — `concept-1-atlas.html`,
`concept-2-orbit.html`, `concept-3-jetstream.html`, `direction-final.html`

## What

Issue #60 shipped the *token layer* of the three design directions: colours, fonts,
radii, `.plate` / `.stamp` / `.smallcaps`, and the paper grain. But the concept
mockups contain a lot of signature visual craft that never made it into the app —
the parts that make each style feel designed rather than re-coloured.

This feature does three things:

1. **Inventories every novel design element** in the mockups that isn't implemented
   (the tables below — the systematic worklist the issue asks for).
2. **Implements the headline items**, including the issue #63 call-outs:
   theme-aware logo, themed leaderboard, Atlas ticket header + ~20 passport stamp
   designs, Orbit dot-matrix maps, Jetstream boarding pass with barcode.
3. **Makes the design system truly pluggable** — a theme registry where each style
   is a self-contained definition (tokens + chrome + component slots), ready for
   unlockable designs at future milestones.

## The pluggable architecture

Issue #60's token layer already gives us the right substrate: everything colour,
font, and radius flows through CSS custom properties re-mapped per
`data-theme`. What was *not* pluggable was everything else — the theme list,
page colours, and any component whose *structure* differs per theme (logo,
stamps, map rendering, header layout) was hardcoded or impossible.

### Theme registry — `client/src/themes/`

Each theme is now a self-contained definition module:

```
client/src/themes/
  registry.js         ← THEMES list; the ONLY place a theme is registered
  atlas/index.jsx     ← definition: metadata + component slots
  atlas/PassportStamp.jsx
  orbit/index.jsx
  jetstream/index.jsx
  shared components (Logo variants, CountryStub variants, …)
```

A definition looks like:

```js
{
  id: 'atlas',
  name: 'Atlas',
  tagline: 'Heirloom expedition atlas',
  swatch: ['#f6f1e7', '#3e5f45', '#c9a227'],
  pageColor: '#f6f1e7',          // <meta name="theme-color">
  Logo,                          // wordmark component (nav + auth pages)
  VisitedStamp,                  // per-country visited mark (Atlas: passport stamps)
  CountryStub,                   // right-hand panel of the country header (or null)
  map: { dots: false },          // world-map render mode (Orbit: dot matrix)
  unlock: null,                  // future: milestone criteria for unlockable themes
}
```

Rules of the system:

- **Tokens stay in CSS** (`index.css` per-`data-theme` blocks) — that part was
  already right. Chrome classes (`.plate`, `.stamp`, `.country-header`, `.lb-*`)
  are theme-scoped CSS keyed off `data-theme`.
- **Structure lives in slots.** Components never branch on `theme.id`; they render
  `theme.Logo`, `theme.VisitedStamp`, `theme.CountryStub`, and consult
  `theme.map.dots`. A new theme plugs in by providing its own slot components (or
  reusing another theme's).
- **`ThemeContext` consumes the registry** — it no longer owns a hardcoded theme
  list, and exposes the full active definition as `themeDef`.
- **Adding a theme** = add `client/src/themes/<id>/`, register it in
  `registry.js`, add a `:root[data-theme="<id>"]` token block, and add the id to
  the server's `STYLE_IDS` (`server/src/lib/schemas.js`) so the account
  preference round-trips. The pre-paint script in `index.html` reads the id from
  localStorage generically.
- **Unlockables (future):** the `unlock` field is reserved for milestone criteria
  (e.g. `{ trophies: 10 }` or `{ countries: 25 }`). The switcher will render
  locked themes greyed with their unlock condition; the server enum stays the
  gatekeeper for persisting a locked choice. Nothing else needs to change.

### Determinism — stamps and barcodes

Charlie's requirement: every country should look a bit different, but the *same*
country must always get the *same* stamp. Both the Atlas stamp variant and the
Jetstream barcode derive from a small hash of the ISO country code
(`client/src/lib/themeArt.js`, unit-tested): 20 stamp designs = 10 shapes × ink
rotation through 6 authentic stamp-pad colours, plus deterministic rotation
jitter; barcodes are per-country bar sequences. No randomness at render time.

### Orbit dot-matrix maps — how

`DotMatrixLayer` renders inside the existing `ComposableMap`: it samples a
uniform grid in projected screen space (pitch ≈ 9px, dot r ≈ 0.35 × pitch,
mirroring the mockup's 9-unit grid / r=3.1), keeps grid points that fall inside a
country polygon (`d3-geo` `geoContains` limited to each feature's projected
bounding box, memoised), and colours each dot by the owning country's
visited/ownership state — visited dots get the cyan glow. The graticule renders
behind at 20° steps. The original `<Geography>` paths stay mounted with
transparent fills on top, so hover, click, and zoom behave identically to the
other themes. Sub-national maps stay solid-fill polygons, exactly as the mockup
specifies ("world = dots, sub-national = lit polygons").

## Open questions

- **Atlas map furniture (compass rose, routes, home star)** — highest-impact
  backlog items; they need a capital-coordinates lookup on the client. Worth its
  own pass with Charlie reviewing the plate composition.
- **Leaderboard designs are extrapolations** — no mockup exists, so the themed
  treatments here follow each theme's established vocabulary. Charlie should
  vet them like a fourth mockup page.
- **Score-so-far on the country header** — the Jetstream stub shows "score so
  far"; we surface the same numbers the page already shows (base, max,
  % explored) rather than inventing a new client-side total that could drift
  from the engine. If we want a true earned total on the header, expose it from
  the scoring queries first.
